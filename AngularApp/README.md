# CondensateAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.2.

## Development server

 Since ASP.NET Core is used to serve the project and API, use `ng build --watch` for the client app and start
 the API with `dotnet watch run` in the `CondensateAPI` folder. This will *not* automatically reload the
 browser if you change any of the source files but will show new changes once you have. Dotnet should be
 serving and is located at `http://localhost:5000`. For a `ng serve` dev server, navigate to
 `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `../CondensateAPI/wwwroot` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
